            Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and
            directions.[1] In classical physics, physical space is often
            conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually
            consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional
            continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered
            to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical
            universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over
            whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or
            part of a conceptual framework. Debates concerning the nature,
            essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity;
            namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his
            reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in
            the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos
            (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as
            "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan)
            of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen.[3] Many of these
            classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance
            and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the
            early development of classical mechanics. In Isaac Newton's view,
            space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and
            independently of whether there was any matter in the space.[4] Other
            natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead
            that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects,
            given by their distance and direction from one another. In the 18th
            century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to
            refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New
            Theory of Vision
